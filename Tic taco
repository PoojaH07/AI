1.Game State Representation

  The board is stored as a dictionary board = {1:' ', 2:' ', ... 9:' '}.
  
  Positions are numbered like a keypad:
  
  1 | 2 | 3
  -+-+-
  4 | 5 | 6
  -+-+-
  7 | 8 | 9

2.Player vs Bot
  
  O = Player
  
  X = Bot (AI)

3.Rules Implemented

  Bot moves first.
  
  Player moves second.
  
  Each move:

    If space is free → place symbol.
    
    Check for win or draw.
    
    If someone wins or board full → game ends.

4.The Algorithm Used → Minimax

  Minimax Algorithm is a backtracking algorithm used in decision-making and game theory.
  
  Idea:
  
    Assume opponent plays optimally.
    
    The Bot (X) tries to maximize its score.
    
    The Player (O) tries to minimize the Bot’s score.
  
  Scores:
  
    +1 → Bot wins
    
    -1 → Player wins
    
    0 → Draw

  At each step:
  
    Bot simulates all possible moves.
    
    Recursively plays the game until terminal state (win/loss/draw).
    
    Chooses the move that guarantees the best score against an optimal opponent.

5.Flow of the Game
  
  Bot uses compMove() → calculates best move using minimax.
  
  Player enters a position → playerMove().
  
  After every move → check for win/draw.
  
  Game continues until either:
  
    Bot wins,
    
    Player wins, or
    
    It’s a draw.
